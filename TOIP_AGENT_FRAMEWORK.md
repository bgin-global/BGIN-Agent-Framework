# Trust over IP (ToIP) Framework for BGIN Agent Team

## Overview
This document outlines how the BGIN AI MVP multi-agent system implements the [Trust over IP (ToIP) framework](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/) to create a trusted, interoperable ecosystem for blockchain governance research and collaboration.

## ToIP Four-Layer Architecture Integration

### Layer 1: Utility Layer
**Purpose**: Provides the foundational trust infrastructure for agent interactions

**BGIN Implementation**:
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Each agent has a unique DID for identity verification
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Agent capabilities and permissions are cryptographically verifiable
- **Trust Registries**: Agent reputation and trust scores are maintained in decentralized registries
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Multi-agent decisions use ToIP-compliant consensus protocols

**Technical Components**:
```typescript
interface AgentDID {
  did: string;
  verificationMethod: string;
  serviceEndpoint: string;
  capabilityInvocation: string[];
}

interface AgentCredential {
  type: "AgentCapabilityCredential";
  issuer: string;
  subject: string;
  credentialSubject: {
    agentType: "archive" | "codex" | "discourse";
    capabilities: string[];
    trustLevel: number;
    permissions: string[];
  };
}
```

### Layer 2: Governance Layer
**Purpose**: Establishes the rules and policies for agent interactions

**BGIN Implementation**:
- **Agent Governance Framework**: Rules for how agents can interact and collaborate
- **Trust Policies**: Privacy-preserving policies for data sharing between agents
- **Consensus Protocols**: How agents reach decisions on research synthesis
- **Dispute Resolution**: Mechanisms for resolving conflicts between agent recommendations

**Governance Components**:
```typescript
interface AgentGovernancePolicy {
  id: string;
  version: string;
  effectiveDate: Date;
  rules: {
    dataSharing: {
      allowedDataTypes: string[];
      privacyLevels: string[];
      consentRequired: boolean;
    };
    collaboration: {
      maxAgentsPerTask: number;
      consensusThreshold: number;
      timeoutPeriod: number;
    };
    trust: {
      minimumTrustScore: number;
      reputationWeight: number;
      verificationRequired: boolean;
    };
  };
}
```

### Layer 3: Credential Layer
**Purpose**: Manages the exchange of verifiable credentials between agents

**BGIN Implementation**:
- **Agent Capability Credentials**: Proof of agent capabilities and specializations
- **Research Credentials**: Verifiable claims about research findings and sources
- **Trust Credentials**: Evidence of successful collaborations and reputation
- **Privacy Credentials**: Proof of compliance with privacy policies

**Credential Types**:
```typescript
interface ResearchCredential {
  type: "ResearchFindingCredential";
  issuer: "archive-agent-did";
  subject: "research-session-id";
  credentialSubject: {
    researchTopic: string;
    methodology: string;
    sources: string[];
    confidence: number;
    privacyLevel: "public" | "restricted" | "confidential";
  };
  proof: {
    type: "Ed25519Signature2020";
    created: Date;
    verificationMethod: string;
    proofPurpose: "assertionMethod";
    jws: string;
  };
}
```

### Layer 4: Application Layer
**Purpose**: Provides the user-facing interfaces and applications

**BGIN Implementation**:
- **Multi-Agent Interface**: User interface for interacting with the agent team
- **Trust Visualization**: Display of trust relationships and reputation scores
- **Privacy Controls**: User interface for managing privacy preferences
- **Collaboration Tools**: Real-time collaboration features for research teams

## Agent Team Formation and Interactions

### Agent Identity and Registration

**1. Agent DID Creation**
```typescript
// Each agent creates a unique DID
const archiveAgentDID = await createAgentDID({
  agentType: "archive",
  capabilities: ["document-analysis", "knowledge-synthesis", "rag-queries"],
  serviceEndpoint: "https://bgin-archive-agent.example.com",
  publicKey: archiveAgentPublicKey
});
```

**2. Capability Credential Issuance**
```typescript
// Agents receive verifiable credentials for their capabilities
const capabilityCredential = await issueCapabilityCredential({
  issuer: "bgin-governance-did",
  subject: archiveAgentDID,
  capabilities: ["document-analysis", "knowledge-synthesis"],
  trustLevel: 0.95,
  expirationDate: new Date(Date.now() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 1 year
});
```

### Trust Network Formation

**1. Trust Relationship Establishment**
```typescript
interface TrustRelationship {
  fromAgent: string; // DID
  toAgent: string; // DID
  trustScore: number; // 0-1
  relationshipType: "collaboration" | "verification" | "endorsement";
  evidence: TrustEvidence[];
  createdAt: Date;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

interface TrustEvidence {
  type: "successful-collaboration" | "verified-claim" | "peer-endorsement";
  description: string;
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  verifiableCredential?: string;
}
```

**2. Reputation Scoring System**
```typescript
interface AgentReputation {
  agentDID: string;
  overallScore: number;
  categoryScores: {
    accuracy: number;
    reliability: number;
    collaboration: number;
    privacy: number;
  };
  totalInteractions: number;
  successfulCollaborations: number;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocols

**1. Task Assignment and Coordination**
```typescript
interface CollaborationTask {
  id: string;
  type: "research-synthesis" | "policy-analysis" | "consensus-building";
  participants: string[]; // Agent DIDs
  requirements: {
    capabilities: string[];
    trustThreshold: number;
    privacyLevel: string;
  };
  status: "pending" | "in-progress" | "completed" | "failed";
  results: CollaborationResult[];
}

interface CollaborationResult {
  agentDID: string;
  contribution: string;
  confidence: number;
  evidence: string[];
  timestamp: Date;
  verifiableCredential: string;
}
```

**2. Consensus Building Process**
```typescript
interface ConsensusProcess {
  taskId: string;
  participants: string[];
  proposals: AgentProposal[];
  voting: AgentVote[];
  consensusReached: boolean;
  finalDecision?: string;
  trustWeights: Map<string, number>;
}

interface AgentProposal {
  agentDID: string;
  proposal: string;
  rationale: string;
  evidence: string[];
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Privacy-Preserving Agent Interactions

### Selective Disclosure Framework
```typescript
interface SelectiveDisclosure {
  agentDID: string;
  requestedData: string[];
  privacyLevel: "maximum" | "high" | "selective" | "minimal";
  consentGiven: boolean;
  dataMinimization: boolean;
  purposeLimitation: string;
  retentionPeriod: number;
}
```

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Agent Capabilities
```typescript
interface AgentCapabilityProof {
  agentDID: string;
  capability: string;
  proof: {
    type: "zk-proof";
    proofValue: string;
    verificationMethod: string;
  };
  revealed: boolean; // Whether the capability is revealed or just proven
}
```
