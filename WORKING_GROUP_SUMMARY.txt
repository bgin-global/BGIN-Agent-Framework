BGIN AI MVP - Working Group Summary
=====================================

PROJECT STATUS: Ready for Block 13 Meeting Deployment
Last Updated: September 2025

OVERVIEW
========
The BGIN AI MVP is a multi-agent privacy-preserving research platform designed for blockchain governance. The system features three specialized agents (Archive, Codex, Discourse) that work together to facilitate research, policy analysis, and community collaboration while maintaining strict privacy controls.

TRUST OVER IP (TOIP) + FIRST PERSON PROJECT (FPP) INTEGRATION
=============================================================
The system implements both the Trust over IP (ToIP) framework (https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/) and First Person Project (FPP) principles (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6834ee7c55c6376908871a6d/t/68cc3a8c99a9e21f398ea782/1758214796847/The+First+Person+Project+White+Paper+V1.0.pdf) to create a trusted, interoperable, and dignity-based ecosystem for agent interactions. This includes:

ToIP Framework:
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for each agent
- Verifiable Credentials for agent capabilities
- Trust network establishment and management
- Privacy-preserving collaboration protocols
- ToIP-compliant consensus mechanisms

FPP Principles:
- Data sovereignty and user control
- Dignity-based economics and reputation systems
- Privacy by design and selective disclosure
- User agency preservation and transparent governance

âœ… COMPLETED:
- Full-stack application (React frontend + Node.js backend)
- Three-agent architecture (Archive, Codex, Discourse)
- Privacy-preserving UI with Kwaai integration points
